# parsa-trading-bot-example

A simple trading bot for Parsa. Not recommended for use as-is, but rather as an example of how to use the Parsa API and scripts to open and close positions.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run start
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.12. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
